# Named Entity Recognition.
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves identifying and categorizing named entities within a text into predefined categories such as names of persons, organizations, locations, dates, quantities, monetary values, percentages, and more. The main goal of NER is to extract and classify these specific entities from unstructured text data to enable further analysis or information extraction.
NER systems typically use machine learning algorithms, particularly sequence labeling models like conditional random fields (CRFs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to analyze and classify words or phrases in a given text into predefined entity categories. These models are trained on labeled datasets where each word or phrase is tagged with its corresponding entity type.
NER is a crucial component in various NLP applications such as information retrieval, question answering systems, chatbots, sentiment analysis, and more. It helps in extracting structured information from unstructured text data, thereby enabling machines to understand and process human language more effectively.
